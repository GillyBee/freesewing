title: Unidades
---

This controls the units used (by the text) on the pattern.

Freesewing supports two types of units:

 - Unidades m√©tricas (cm)
 - Unidades imperiales (pulgadas)

You can configure your default units in your account settings.  
In addition, you can set the units individually for each model.  
And if that wasn't enough, you can still override the units for an individual pattern with this setting.
